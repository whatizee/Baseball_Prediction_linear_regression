# Moneyball MLB Analysis

## Overview
This repository delves into the realm of baseball success inspired by the movie Moneyball. Our focus is on unraveling the secret to success in Major League Baseball (MLB) by exploring the relationships between runs scored in a season and various player statistics.

## Motivation
Similar to the low-budget Oakland Athletics in Moneyball, we believe that certain underused statistics may better predict a team's ability to score runs compared to traditional metrics like home runs, RBIs, and batting average. Our goal is to identify these predictive variables through a comprehensive analysis of data from all 30 MLB teams.

## Data
We've compiled data encompassing player statistics from all 30 MLB teams. These statistics include a player's ability to get on base, among other metrics. Our dataset serves as the foundation for exploring the linear relationships between runs scored in a season and these player statistics.

## Methodology
Our analysis involves both graphical and numerical summaries to understand the linear relationships comprehensively. By employing these methods, we aim to pinpoint the variable, if any, that best predicts a team's runs scored in a season.

## Repository Structure
- **data:** Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- **notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks detailing the step-by-step analysis.
- **visualizations:** Graphical summaries and visual representations.
- **results:** Numerical summaries and insights obtained.
